# Local analysis

Directory contains all processed data reported in the manuscript, as well as the Jupyter notebooks used to generate all plots for all figures. To analyze the processed data, first run all Jupyter notebooks in `inference/`. Then run all Jupyter notebooks in the `figX` directories. This will recreate all the computational data analysis plots in Main Text and Supplemental Information.
